          <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
          <p>Gemsbok is light taupe to tan in color,
            with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump.
            Their tails are long and black in color.
              A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck,
              through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg.
              They have muscular necks and shoulders,
              and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs,
               and both genders have long, straight horns.
               Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail,
               has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks.
              One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx",
            in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.
            Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus oryx</p>
                <h4>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h4>
                <p>You will find the Gemsbok right next to the panda canyon </p>
