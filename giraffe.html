          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>The South African giraffe is found in northern South Africa, 
            southern Botswana, southern Zimbabwe, and south-western Mozambique. After local extinctions in various places,
             the South African giraffes have been reintroduced in many parts of Southern Africa, including in Eswatini. 
             They are common in both in and outside of protected areas. 
             South African giraffes usually live in savannahs and woodlands where food plants are available. 
             Giraffes are herbivorous animals.
              They feed on leaves, flowers, fruits and shoots of woody plants such as Acacia.
            South African giraffes live in a fission-fusion society system based on things such as sex, age, season, and kinship.
             This allows them to adapt better to environmental changes around them.
