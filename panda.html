          <h3>PANDA</h3>
          <p>Pandas are born looking like baby badgers â€” fur-less, pink, and blind. The iconic black and white colour comes later, after about three weeks.

            Not all giant pandas are black and white! A few are brown and white, but these are very rare.</p>
            <p>Pandas are usually born in August, because the panda's mating months are March to May and gestation is 3 to 5 months.

                Females mainly produce two offspring, but only the stronger one survives in the wild. In the research bases in Chengdu, the other twin is hand-reared, and swapped regularly with the mother so she can raise two cubs each pregnancy. Some of the money you pay in entrance fees funds this successful project.</p>
